# MogiiBot3
MogiiBot3 is a Discord Bot, developed using Discord.Net 1.0. The Bot was developed for use on the MogiiCraft Discord Server.

# Use of the code
You may use the code within the terms of the license. Unfortunately, I can not help you set up the Bot or give you a detailed tutorial on how to do so, but I can provide some pointers.

The code makes references to a library called MelissasCode, where methods and variables such as the Bot Token are stored. I will not be sharing this library therefore, if you decide to use my code, you will need to find all of these methods and variables and change them yourself.
